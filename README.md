## World Eater Progress Tracker
A simple Minecraft Console Client (MCC) script that enables players on Minecraft redstone servers to easily monitor the progress of world eaters without the need to enter the game.
It utilizes the `!!vris` command from an MCDReforged plugin to retrieve the positions of AFK players or bots attached to the world eater flying machines.

## World Eater Progress Tracker
A simple Minecraft Console Client (MCC) script that enables Minecraft redstone server players to easily monitor the progress of world eaters within the game. It utilizes the `!!vris` command from an MCDReforged plugin to retrieve the positions of AFK players or bots attached to the world eater flying machines.
